#### Problem Description?
Being a Masters in Data Science student myself, I was interested in the statistics of higher education students. Analysing this data will provide us with several insighs which we can use to dive deeper and research questions such as:
- Which courses do foreigners usually opt for and how to market them better.   
- Which courses are male/female dominant.
- Why are some courses more popular than the others? Do we need better marketing? or is it a language barrier issue?

## How to get started and Requirements

Download the repository and have ipython as well as matplotlib and pandas installed. 
Test it using Python 3.11.3 - I do not give gurantees that it works with older versions.

## Running the Program

Copy the ipyton/ Jupyter notebook and open on your preferable editor. Run the notebook to view results.

Program files are stored in the src folder.
Further documentation can be found in the description.txt

## Dataset

The Dataset is from [Genesis,](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online) a statistical data service provided by the German government. Dataset used is GENESIS-Tabelle: 21352-0003, Statistics of doctoral students.
I have created 2 csv for this: The first has course groups only while the 2nd has all the courses. 
- Data is recorded from 2019 - 2022. 
- Main header has Year, Course Group/ Course, German, Foreigner and Total Columns. Where German, Foreigner and Total refer to the number of students.
- 2nd header has Male and Female column for the German, Foreigner and Total Columns.
